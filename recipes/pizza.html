        Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). It is made 
        with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are cheese, sausages,
        pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These toppings are 
        added over a piece of bread covered with sauce.
